## What is Solana Suite?

Solana Suite is a client SDK that allows individuals with no prior blockchain
development experience or web2.0 background to quickly build blockchain services
without the need to fully understand the intricacies of Solana's specifications.
With just one function, you can achieve what you want.

## Why is Solana Suite create?

There is always a shortage of blockchain engineers, but there is a surplus of
Web2.0 engineers. I thought that by converting these engineers, we could
potentially address the shortage of engineers.

I wanted more people to be aware of the greatness of Solana. Solana has a unique
architecture that sets it apart from other blockchains, which can make it
challenging to understand. I believed that if there was an SDK that could be
used without being aware of Solana's specific specifications, it could be
adopted by a larger audience.
